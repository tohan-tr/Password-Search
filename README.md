Password Search is a web application that checks whether a given password exists in a database of 20 million leaked passwords and saves any missing passwords to a new file. Built with Flask, this tool provides a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JS for quick and easy usage.
Features

    Password Lookup: The entered password is searched in the password/password.txt file, and the user is notified if the password is found.
    Add New Password: If the password is not found in password.txt, it is automatically added to password/new.txt in the password folder.
    View Total Number of Passwords: By clicking on the information icon, the total number of stored passwords can be viewed.
    Copying Disabled: To increase security, right-clicking and copying actions are disabled.
